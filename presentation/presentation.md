## About Me

Freelance IT Consultant - specializing in application development.
Specializes in TDD.

Was hired to start a microservice initiative. The existing codebase was PHP
based, which is not suitable for a micro service environment.
Some people had gained an interest in Go, so we started a go.

### Services build with Go.

  * Data acquisition for Machine Learning engine (not too suitable)
  * Handling integration between subsystems, e.g. different media planning
      systems and financial systems. (Better)

## History/Background

## Pros

  * Somewhat predictable memory handling, e.g. through the use of pointers.
  * Pretty

## Cons

  * No well established package management handling (no semver)
  * Idiomatic error handling can become a bit awkward.
