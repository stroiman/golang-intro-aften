## Useful tools

** rerun **

Watches your source folder, and when files change, it can build, test, and run
your application.

```
go get github.com/skelterjohn/rerun
```

From the project folder, run `rerun --build gohome` (it will not find the
correct static files, if you are not in the correct folder)
